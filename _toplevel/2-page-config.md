Each page can add (or override if they are already defined at site level) some elements through its [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

- `lang`: two-letter ISO code.
- `additional_css`: a list of CSS files to be included (can be externally hosted, or relative to the `/css` folder).
